In this assignment we were given four quarters of stock prices and their varrying change in prices and stock volume over each quarter. Our assingment was to take this data and create two "leaderboards". The first leaderboard contained each stock in the quarter and its price change, percent change, and total stock volume. The second "Leaderboard" was to show for each quarter which stock had the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and the largest stock volume.
